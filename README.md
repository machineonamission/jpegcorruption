## to use
### requirements
only required package is [Pillow/PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/). Script was written and tested in python 3.8.
### to run
open `main.py` and edit lines 8-14 (the paramaters) then run `main.py`. Input image must be in the same folder as `main.py` unless an absolute path is specified. I reccomend giving the script its own folder to prevent it from messing with whatever files it lives in.
